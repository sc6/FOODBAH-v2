	FOODBAH is a welcoming community of food writers and critics who are open to new tastes and ideas. This is a place where you 
	can share that particularly bad restaurant you visited the other day, or commend that special local joint you've been going to for 
	the past month or so, all while being open to people who may have different opinions than you. Meet new people and share new thoughts about 
	food, the common necessity which brings all people together.
	<br><br>
	Not quite ready to write yet? No problem. There's still much to do here. Join a local FOODBAH food group tailored to your taste and/or diet. Subscribe to your favorite 
	writer in order to follow their journey of delicious food. Or, search from over hundreds of restaurants to find honest conversations about their food, 
	athmosphere, or service.
	<br><br>
	Coming soon.
